# Elite Trading Tool Companion
E:D Market Connector plugin to access the Elite Trading Tool API.
Plugin currently only finds the best trading route (loop ?) at your system location.

Yes, it's pretty hard to read right now, but it shows every single information also shown on the trading tool website.

Total profit in parenthesis is based on your ship's cargo size.

Please also note the buttons do not render when the dark theme is used.
